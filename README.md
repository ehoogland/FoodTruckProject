# Food Truck Application

### Description
Briefly, users input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average
rating and the highest-rated truck. All trucks may also be viewed.

The program illustrates the concept of encapsulation in that instance fields
are private and getters and setters are used to access information. These and
an explicit toString() method were used.

Data storage of objects in an array is useful, and having an explicit toString()
method facilitates viewing the data fields of those objects.

### Technologies Used
Eclipse IDE
vi, atom text editors
Apple MacBook Pro computer
git

### Lessons Learned

Do show up for optional Saturday sessions.

Relatively minor problems could not be solved due to a deadline crunch.
Restaurant ratings were made on a scale of 1 to 100 instead of 1 to 5,
as the program does not explicitly deal with equal scores.

Don't panic. Get some sleep for an hour and you may feel better.

OOP can begin to be learned.

Slow down. Create diagrams before you begin coding. OOP and OOD can be complex,
and you can become trapped in a morass if you don't prepare beforehand.
